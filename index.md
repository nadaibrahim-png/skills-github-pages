# Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio 📊

Hello! I am a Data Science enthusiast. This site hosts my technical essays, project walk-throughs, and insights into the world of data.

  ## Migration and Crime in Europe: A Data-Driven Analysis

### 1. Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between asylum seeker influxes and police-recorded crime rates across the EU-27. 

### 2. The Methodology
I used Python to fetch data via the Eurostat API, focusing on **First-time asylum applicants** and **Theft rates per 100,000 inhabitants** to ensure a fair comparison between nations.

### 3. Visualized Results
Below is the correlation analysis generated from my Python script.

### 4. Data Interpretation (The "So What?")
Based on the scatter plot above, we can observe several key insights:
* **The Trend Line:** (Example: If the line is flat, write: "The trend line remains relatively flat, suggesting that there is no strong linear correlation between the volume of asylum seekers and property crime rates.")
* **Outliers:** (Example: "Countries like Germany show high numbers in both categories due to total population, but when looking at the *rate* per 100k, they align with the EU average.")
* **Conclusion:** Data suggests that socio-economic factors (like the inflation data we discussed) often play a larger role in crime trends than migration volume alone.
